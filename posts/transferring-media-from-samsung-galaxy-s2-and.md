Title: Transferring Media from Samsung Galaxy S2 and Ubuntu

I have captured a large number of images in my Samsung S2 (thanks to the
awesome camera), however transferring from the phone to the laptop has always
been a painful core. The usual requirement would be to get out of the chair
(lazy :)) and grab the chord or go about searching for it.

When I was travelling few days back with my roommate I managed to
exchange some pictures between our phones via bluetooth and thought the same
would be nice to transfer data between the phone and the laptop.

I switched on the blue tooth on the phone as well as the mobile, paired the
devices and when I tried to push the image from the mobile to the laptop the
transfers were consistently failing with a "Connection Failed" message. The
transfer from laptop to mobile worked fine. A google search brought up the
following
[link](http://techareena.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/how-to-receive-files-over-bluetooth-in-ubuntu/)
where the author mentions to enable sharing of files via blue tooth.

In order to enable it you have to open "Personal File Sharing", in 12.04+ you
can search for it by pressing the "Window" key and typing the above phrase and
then enabling the option "Share Files Over Bluetooth" (See screenshot below)
