I have been using Linux for a few years. I started out with Ubuntu then
switched to Fedora thereafter OpenSUSE and back to Ubuntu again. However the
one thing that was a mystery for a while was the Linux File System Hierarchy.
At first glance it seems to be a total mess, then after a while it would seem
like something simple has been made complicated (why not when you are used to
finding everthing inside a SYSTEM folder), a bit further you would see it as a
paranoid attempt to organize and if you persist longer the rationale behind it
will unfold:

> Everything is in its place, and there is a place for everything.

I bumped into an article explaining the Linux explaning the file system
hierarchy at [GeekStuff.com](http://http://www.thegeekstuff.com/) and found
it to be useful. It explains the Linux File System Hierarchy in a brief and
concise manner
[http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/linux-file-system-structure/).
Don't forget to read the comments they are very insightful.

If you want to go into more detail, then dive into the

exhaustive :).
