This is and might be the smallest post I ever make.

You can scroll the gnome terminal with your keyboard using "Ctrl + Shift
<Up/Down Arrow Keys>". Also you can page and up and down using "Ctrl + Shift
<Page Up/Down Keys>". Further you can search the contents in the terminal by
pressing "Ctrl + Shift f" a search dialog will pop-up.
